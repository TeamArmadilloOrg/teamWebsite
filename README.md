# Team Armadillo Website

This repository hosts the source code for our Team Website

## Website build checklist

- [x] Create Repository in Github
- [x] Create a develop branch
- [x] Update readme
- [X] Make initial commit tagging Jira Issue
- [x] Initial merge with master branch

## Main Website Components

- [ ] Landing Page with access to the main site. Landing page can include rotational images and a "start here" button

- [ ] Main homepage should have a navigation bar at the top with menus (home, meet the team, current projects, contact us, etc) This   should be responsive and collapse down to a hamburger style menu and navbar for mobile devices

- [ ] All pages should include a footer to house the copyright material and a list of quick links to each menu item. Might be cool to include google maps for location of team members.

- [ ] Along with the contact us menu option, we can include a request services form if we decide to allow people to request help or additional information.


## Team Member pages

- [ ] Each team member will design their information page. We need to decide if we want these to all be different. Or if we want a template created and each member fills in the template with their flavor of information.

- [ ] Header and Footer should remain the same to improve the UX of the website.

- [ ] Members should incorporate links to social media outlets to help network. Bring in your LinkedIN,instagram, facebook, twitter feeds into the website.

- [ ] Use vibrant visuals to attract attention
