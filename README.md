# Team Armadillo Website

This repository hosts the source code for our Team Website

## Website Build Checklist

- [x] Create repository in Github
- [x] Create a develop branch
- [x] Update readme
- [X] Make initial commit tagging Jira Issue
- [x] Initial merge with master branch

## Main Website Components

- [ ] Landing page with access to the main site. Landing page can include rotational images and a "start here" button

- [ ] Main homepage should have a navigation bar at the top with menus (home, meet the team, current projects, contact us, etc) This   should be responsive and collapse down to a hamburger style menu and navbar for mobile devices

- [ ] All pages should include a footer to house the copyright material and a list of quick links to each menu item. Might be cool to include google maps for location of team members.

- [ ] Along with the contact us menu option, we can include a request services form if we decide to allow people to request help or additional information.


## Team Member Pages

- [ ] Each team member will design their information page. We need to decide if we want these to all be different. Or if we want a template created and each member fills in the template with their flavor of information.

- [ ] Header and footer should remain the same to improve the UX of the website.

- [ ] Members should incorporate links to social media outlets to help network. Bring in your LinkedIN,instagram, facebook, twitter feeds into the website.

# Website Intent

## Who is Team Armadillo?

We are an international team from different backgrounds with a common goal of learning to code in a practical way. We want to produce something with our own personality. We want to challenge ourselves to learn new tools and skills and contribute to a project. At the same time, we want to try and produce something that will have a positive impact on people’s lives.


## How we Formed

We are a group of like-minded people who are part of the giant #100DaysOfCode community and have a common goal –  take our technical knowledge and improve it.

> “How we came to be – in such a random manner – that’s a story in itself.”


## Our Goals

Our purpose is simple and focussed. We all want to code. Whatever we do, we want it to be beneficial – otherwise, why are we building it?

We want to show who we are as individuals, but at the same time show what that looks like from a team perspective and how that can happen.

What we do may also help push us forward in our workplaces or towards any career goals we might have.


## The Strapline

We build tools through global collaboration, in hopes to improve and grow the lives of those we bring together.

>"You are our reason why! "


## Purpose of the Website

- Showcase who we are and what our goals are.

- Showcase the projects we’re working on.

- Showcase how much we’ve grown.

- Show what’s possible from a group of self-taught developers.

- Inspire others to take part in something similar.

- Show what capabilities you can gain from being self-taught and working in a community together with people who are at different levels of experience.

>“We met in a challenge environment, then broke off and became a team and were able to achieve – this.”


## Site Access

The design needs to be responsive and accessible from mobile, tablets, desktops.


## The Audience

The site is for people to find out more about Team Armadillo, it’s background, goals projects and team members.


## The Logo

>“I used basic colours and very simple aesthetics and forms. Once we decide our goal as a team, we can revisit our logo so that it defines us.”

A possible challenge is to cartoon the logo as a type of mascot [Salesforce example] 


## Basis of Design

- The site should have a minimalist aesthetic.

- Include an initial minimalist screen that introduces the group, then launches into the site on a click.

- From a user perspective, a website that has a constant (fluid) aesthetic is the most enjoyable.

- The site is multi-paged.

- Page styles are kept the same throughout.

- Navbars work well on responsive websites (collapsing to a burger menu on mobile). Images as links also work well.

- Mobile first mindset is a good idea. We also need to work on a desktop version.

- The site needs to be compatible across browsers and platforms.

- The site has a team page / section then individual pages where team members introduce themselves. Once we have a template in place, team members can add their own text content to their section / page and showcase themselves through links to social media.

*Comment: The following are maybe not the minimalist concept we’re about - but I like the playful interactivity on these sites. They are fun to explore and don’t take themselves too seriously. There is visual feedback for most elements when you hover over them and menu selection is often fun and a bit alternative.
The sites tell a story. It’s good to spend time there. Added to inspire.*

*Comment: I like the simplicity of the image and the subdued colour. I also like the menu action (top right) If you don’t want to use the hamburger menu, you can also scroll down the page to get the same info.*

## Quotes From the Team

>“We want to achieve something that we can look back on and say “that is the mark that I put on my community”

>“Keep our purpose simple and focussed: We all want to code. We’re an international group. We’re from various different backgrounds”

>“Whatever we end up doing, we want it to be beneficial: otherwise, why are we doing it?”

>“Answer the ‘why’. The intent is: Why should someone want to use this application? Why am I going to choose this application over another?”

>“You have such flexibility. You look for some challenge, then you meet up with some people from completely different countries and completely different time zones. But it doesn’t matter, because we’re so close. We have so much flexibility these days. It’s just awesome!”

>“We’re seeing more of this kind of environment in this industry. All across the world people are working together. That scares a lot of people -that you’re going to lose accountability - but we can show we have the tools available to us, we have the knowledge and we have the resources. Look what we can so!”

>“Our ‘why?’ We want to inspire others, that you can do a project with people from all around the world and teach yourself things you want to learn and use this to build something good, something useful”
